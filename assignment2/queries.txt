1a:

SELECT *
  FROM Frequency
 WHERE docid = '10398_txt_earn' 


1b:

SELECT *
  FROM Frequency
 WHERE docid = '10398_txt_earn' 
       AND
       count = 1;

1c:

SELECT *
  FROM Frequency
 WHERE docid = '10398_txt_earn' 
       AND
       count = 1
UNION
SELECT *
  FROM Frequency

       AND
       count = 1;


SELECT count( DISTINCT term )
  FROM frequency
 WHERE docid IN ( '10398_txt_earn', '925_txt_trade' ) 
       AND
       count = 1;


1d:

SELECT *
  FROM frequency
 WHERE term = 'parliament';


1e:

SELECT docid
  FROM Frequency
 GROUP BY docid
HAVING SUM( count ) > 300;


1f:  That's it!  A join on docid between the two filtered lists.

SELECT docid
  FROM Frequency
 WHERE term = 'transactions'
INTERSECT
SELECT docid
  FROM Frequency
 WHERE term = 'world';


SELECT count( * )
  FROM ( 
    SELECT DISTINCT ( docid )
               FROM frequency
              WHERE term = 'transactions' 
                    AND
                    count > 0
    INTERSECT
    SELECT DISTINCT ( docid )
               FROM frequency
              WHERE term = 'world' 
                    AND
                    count > 0 
);


2g:  That's it!  Join columns to rows, group by rows and columns, then filter to get the cell you want.

SELECT a.row_num,
       b.col_num,
       SUM( a.value * b.value )
  FROM A a
       JOIN B b
         ON a.col_num = b.row_num
 GROUP BY a.row_num,
          b.col_num;


3h:

SELECT sum( f1.count * f2.count )
  FROM frequency f1
       JOIN frequency f2
         ON f1.term = f2.term
 WHERE f1.docid = '10080_txt_crude' 
       AND
       f2.docid = '17035_txt_earn';


3i:  That's it!  Use the query like  document, and then compute the similarity of the query with every document, and find the max score.

SELECT max( tot )
  FROM ( 
    SELECT f.docid,
           sum( f.count * q.count ) AS tot
      FROM frequency f
           JOIN ( 
            SELECT *
              FROM frequency
            UNION
            SELECT 'q' AS docid,
                   'washington' AS term,
                   1 AS count
            UNION
            SELECT 'q' AS docid,
                   'taxes' AS term,
                   1 AS count
            UNION
            SELECT 'q' AS docid,
                   'treasury' AS term,
                   1 AS count 
        ) 
        q
             ON f.term = q.term
     WHERE q.docid = 'q'
     GROUP BY f.docid 
);
